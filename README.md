This project is an implementation of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system.
OFDM is a key technology in modern wireless communication systems, enabling high data rates and robust performance in challenging channel conditions.
This implementation serves as a demonstration of OFDM principles and can be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for further research.
